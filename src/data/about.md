# Intro

I am a business oriented software developer. I started my career in business/banking at 17 years old at Washington Mutual now Chase Bank. I have been interested in technology and software since the age of 10 where I built remote controlled cars and dealt with AOL's dial up internet to learn how to jailbreak Palm-Pilots.

# Currently

I am working at Grub Runner/Text2Order as an intern where I continue to learn about ReactJS, Python and more. I am also enrolled in [Udemy's monthly subscription](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500002721401) which allows me to learn new programming languages, frameworks and to stay sharp on my programming skills. I have dozens of ideas for applications such as a clone of [Clearview AI](https://www.clearview.ai/) and a dashboard for medical doctors to see a history of questions and answers to one another.


# Some history

I officially changed careers in May 2022. I joined a software engineering immersive at General Assembly in May 2022 to become a full stack software engineer. During my coding bootcamp I was struck by a car breaking multiple facial bones and requiring stitches and other medical care for other injuries including a concussion. During this time I did not quit my coding bootcamp because I am incredibly motivated to code.
