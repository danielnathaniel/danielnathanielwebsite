I started my career in business/banking at 17 years old at Washington Mutual now Chase Bank. I have been interested in technology and software since the age of 10 where I built remote controlled cars and dealt with AOL's dial up internet to learn how to jailbreak Palm-Pilots.\n\n# Currently\n\nI am enrolled in [Udemy's] (https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500002721401) monthly subscription which allows me to learn new programming languages, frameworks and to stay sharp on my programming skills. I have dozens of ideas for applications such as a clone of [Clearview] (https://www.clearview.ai/) [AI] (https://www.clearview.ai/) and a dashboard for medical doctors to see a history of questions and answers to one another.\n\n\n# Some history\n\n- I officially changed careers in May 2023. I joined a software engineering immersive at General Assembly in May 2023 to become a full stack software engineer. During my coding bootcamp I was struck by a car breaking multiple facial bones and requiring stitches and other medical care for other injuries including a concussion. During this time I did not quit my coding bootcamp because I am incredibly motivated to code. \n\n# I like\n\n- Swimming\n- Snowboarding\n- Boating and the sea\n- Summer\n- [Books](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Now-Guide-Spiritual-Enlightenment/dp/1577314808)\n- Podcasts [The Tech News Briefing](https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/tech-news-briefing?mod=podcasts_tile), ([The Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily), [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/), , [The Journal](https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal), [Dev Interrupted](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/dev-interrupted/id1537003676)\n\n\n# I dream of\n\n- being a positive example for what I want to see in others.\n- eliminating childhood hunger\n- enabling others to see and utilize their potential .\n- improving myself.\n- getting job offers from you reviewing this.\n",d=c.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,h=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return(0,l.jsx)(i.rU,(0,a.Z)({},n))};n.default=function(){return(0,l.jsx)(r.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Daniel Nathaniel",children:(0,l.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,l.jsx)("header",{children:(0,l.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,l.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,l.jsx)(i.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,l.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),(0,l.jsx)(o(),{source:c,renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
